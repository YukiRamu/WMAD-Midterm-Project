WADP 410 – Midterm Project			                   
 
Objective: (a) to exercise HTML and CSS skills and (b) to work as a team.

HTML and CSS: %65 (code quality of final work, clear indication of work done)
Teamwork: %35 (attending classes, usage of GitHub, maintaining consistency)

Note: In this assignment, you do not need JavaScript. You should also avoid using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap (don’t worry about responsive design either). Just pure HTML and CSS.

Decide with your team whether to work on an analytic or a synthetic project. 
Analytic: inspect and replicate a website or page;
For this task, investigate the www.medium.com. You will need to create at least: (i) a home page, (ii) an article page, (iii) a profile page.
Synthetic: create a website on a certain theme;
For this task, you will create an online shopping website. Choose a theme (e.g. electronics), research similar websites, and come up with a plan.
Discuss how to divide the work between team members. Clearly indicate who is working on what and stick to it.
Create detailed wireframes for your website. Indicate width, length, color, font-size, font-family and other details of your design on the wireframes.
Use HTML and CSS to develop your website. 
Present your work on Friday. In your presentation, tell us about:
Why you choose that project?
How did you divide the work between team members?
Show us your wireframes. 
Show us the structure of your code.
